How to create a java project?

How to create a java class within the project?
*Right click on the project=====>New====>class
*In the dialog box for creating new Java class dont mention any package name ( We will discuss about the 
 packages later during our session) by default the package name is same as that of the project name.
 Delete the text which is shown for the package name.
* Mention the class name.Please follow the convention of naming a class.
* select the checkbox to have main method in the class created.
* In the code editor, just write syso and press ctrl+spacebar.
* Right click on the code editor, Run as ====>Java application.
* To save the file content press ctrl+s.

String[] args / String args[] both are correct.

class hello{
   public static void main(String args[]){
   System.out.print("Hello");
   }
  }

The code compiles and shows the output as Hello.
But we should follow the convention of class naming.So here we mentioned hello where H should be in uppercase.

class Hello{
   public static void main(string args[]){
   System.out.print("Hello");
   }
  }
The code will not compile because we are writing the String class as string.    

class Hello{
   public static void main(String str[]){
   System.out.print("Hello");
   }
  }
The code compiles and shows the output as Hello.

class Hello{
   public static void main(String str[]){
   System.out.print("Hello")
   }
  }
The code will not compile because we missed statement ending with ;.

class Data {
   public static void main(String args[]){
      int num=10;
    }
 }

8 bits=1 byte 

The following are 8 primitive datatypes:
* char which can store a character
  char alpha='A';
  char alpha='$';
  char alpha='1';
  For character storage we have 2 bytes of memory
* byte 1 byte   
* short 2 bytes 
* int   4 bytes
* long  8 bytes
* float 4 bytes
* double 8 bytes
* boolean => true/false 1 bit

// A single line comment
/* This is a demo 
   of multiple lines comment */

long l=100000;
// In the above line int value 100000 is assigned to a long variable l which is possible because int is 
// having a size of 4 bytes which can be stored in 8 bytes of memory which for long datatype.

Long var=100000L;
// We are assigning a long value to a long variable.


float var=12.34;
// The above line shows compilation error because 12.34 is a double value which is assigned to a float variable
// The size of float variable is of 4 bytes which is lesser than double which is of 8 bytes.

float var=12.34f;
float var2=12.34F;
// In the above 2 lines as the value is with the suffix f or F. Which depicts that the value in RHS is of
  float type which is assigned to a float variable.


float var3=20;
// The above line will compile without an error becuase both float and int are having the same size of 4bytes.
 // So 20 is an int value which is stored or assigned in a variable of float type.


double d=12.34;
// The above line is fine as 12.34 is a double value which is assigned to a double variable.

double d=10;
// The above line is fine as we are assigning an int value to a double variable. int is having a size of
// 4 bytes which can be assigned to a double variable which is having a size of 8 bytes.


char ch=65;
// The above line will compile without any error as int can be assigned to a char datatype.

//This is my demo of primitive data type
public class Data1 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		char alpha='a';
		int num=10;
		//float f=10.25; here we are assigning a double value to a float variable. 10.25 is a double value which is assigned to a float variable f 
		double d=10.25; // here we dont have any compilation error because the 10.25 which is double value is assigned to a double variable
        float var=10.25f;
          var=10.25F;
         // In line 11 we have declared and initialise a float variable var with a float value as the value 10.25 is with the suffix f
        // In line 12 the suffix is F
         boolean b=true;
         System.out.println(alpha);
         System.out.println(num);
         System.out.println(d);
         System.out.println(var);
         System.out.println(b);
         alpha=65;
         System.out.println(alpha);
         alpha=97;
         System.out.println(alpha);
         
	}

}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The variable needs to be initialised before the access. Otherwise it will be a compilation error.

class Data2 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int num;
		System.out.println(num);

	}

}

//The local variable num may not have been initialized
// The above code is with error because we have not initialised num are we are trying to display the
// value of num.

class Data3 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int num=10;
		System.out.println(num);

	}

}

class Data4 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int num;
                num=10;
		System.out.println(num);

	}

}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


class Demo {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int quantity;
		float totalCost = 10 * quantity; // error on this line
		System.out.println(totalCost);
	}
}
